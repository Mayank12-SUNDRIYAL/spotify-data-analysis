# spotify-data-analysis
This project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of Spotify data, leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, Glue, S3, and Athena. The pipeline enables efficient data processing and analysis, with a focus on scalability and automation.

Project Overview
The ETL pipeline performs the following steps:

Extract: Spotify data is extracted using the Spotipy Python library.
Transform: Data is transformed in AWS Lambda, preparing it for analysis.
Load: The transformed data is loaded into AWS S3 and queried using AWS Athena.
Analyze: Athena is used for querying the data and generating insights.
Key Components:
Lambda Functions: Handle the data transformation and trigger the ETL process.
AWS Glue: Used for additional data transformations.
S3: Stores the raw and processed data.
Athena: Provides a serverless querying interface for analysis.
Spotipy Layer: A custom AWS Lambda layer containing the Spotipy library for interacting with Spotify’s API.
Installation
Prerequisites
AWS Account
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
Python 3.x
Spotipy library
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spotify-data-etl.git
AWS Lambda Setup:

Upload the custom Spotipy layer (spotipy_layer.zip) to AWS Lambda.
Deploy the Lambda function using the provided script (spotify_transformation_load_function.py).
AWS Glue Setup:

Configure an AWS Glue job for further data transformation.
Athena Setup:

Set up an Athena database and table for querying the processed data in S3.

Usage
Run the ETL Pipeline: Trigger the AWS Lambda function to start the data extraction, transformation, and loading process.

Analyze the Data: Use AWS Athena to run SQL queries on the processed data stored in S3 to generate insights on Spotify’s dataset.

Future Enhancements
Implement real-time data streaming using AWS Kinesis.
Add more detailed reporting and visualization using AWS QuickSight.
